The Book Haven
A cozy and secure platform for book lovers with innovative DDoS attack mitigation

Project Overview
The Book Haven is more than just a platform for discovering and purchasing books. It serves as an innovative demonstration of how modern technologies can protect online resources from cyber threats.
Weâ€™ve integrated functionality to monitor and mitigate DDoS attacks, showcasing how the system can automatically respond to abnormal activities and maintain seamless performance.

Key Features
Interactive Library:

Intuitive book search functionality.
Interactive previews with detailed descriptions.
Personalized recommendations to enhance the user experience.
DDoS Protection Implementation:

Automated detection of suspicious traffic patterns.
Real-time traffic analysis and response to ensure platform stability.
Metrics dashboard to visualize attack patterns and system defenses.
Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML, CSS for responsive design.
JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic features.

Security Features:

DDoS detection algorithms using traffic analysis.
Rate-limiting and IP blacklisting mechanisms.
DDoS Mitigation Process
Monitoring Traffic:
The system continuously monitors incoming requests to detect unusual spikes in activity.
Detection:
Abnormal patterns, such as repeated requests from specific IPs or regions, trigger alerts.
Mitigation:
The platform employs rate-limiting to manage traffic surges.
IP blacklisting ensures malicious actors are blocked in real time.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to explore and test the project:

Simulate a DDoS Attack (optional):
Use a traffic simulator tool (e.g., LOIC or a custom script) to generate traffic and observe how the system mitigates attacks.

Future Enhancements
Advanced AI-based anomaly detection for improved security.
Integration of book reviews and ratings for a richer user experience.
Expanding DDoS metrics visualization with detailed graphs and reports.
